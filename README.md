Hi I am Venky Ananthanarayana.

Here is my attempt at solving the problem given to me.
I had fun solving  this problem

I used Perl to solve this problem.
My solution mimicks an Index to achieve speed.

I have used some perl modules that are a not a part of the standard distribution
please make sure you install them before uyou begin. These modules can be installed from cpan.

They are
1. JSON
2. Log::Log4perl
3. Term::Prompt
4. Try::Tiny
5. YAML

The application requires that a directory conatinging the JSON files to be used for processing is either supplied
via the configuration file or there is a directory called "inputFiles" at the same level as the bin directory or this file.

I have assumed that the Organization_id is the key that relates all the entities together.


It is next to impossible to offend me. Therefore may I please request "Please be as critical or ruthless as you can be during the code review process.". 

Please share your valuable comments and feedback on viyer2@gmail.com. If there is an oppurtunity to improve and I can do something better please let me know. I take feedback very positively and will strive to improve.
